# E-Commerce-App

#Popular examples: Airbnb, Uber, UberEats, Doordash, Etsy, Udemy

e-commerce apps may provide a service to consumers. If it is a service that is provided locally, an interactive map could be added to the app to provide for the service provider and customer to know each others' location. Food delivery applications such as UberEats and Doordash, which require the location of the person ordering the food, come to mind.

Regardless of what's being sold, whether it's physical or virtual, every e-commerce app will consist of some storefront with the product or service details. If users can purchase multiple products at once, it should have a shopping cart where users can manage the products they want to buy.

Finally, every e-commerce app needs a checkout process where users can either purchase their products anonymously or once they are authenticated.
